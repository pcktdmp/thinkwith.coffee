title: 'Engineering- and Development Management in a Nutshell'
---

This time not a blogpost but a sketch.

Sometimes you let your thoughts go into sketching, especially after a nice summer holiday, which is also valuable to share.

I call it “Engineering- and Development Management in a Nutshell”. 

The bottom line of the story is what is not drawn here and is going to speak in your mind:

- the wind thrusting to the rock of success.
- do not forget the teams past achievements.
- let everyone around you slipstream as much as possible.
- get a bigger boat if possible and have as many on board.
- foster and nurture team spirit.
