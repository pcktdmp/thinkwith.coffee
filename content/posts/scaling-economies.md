title: 'Programming with natural language'
---
What effectively changes with software development in the AI era, is that you are going to program with natural language instead of machine language.

We made machine language somewhat easy to understand by humans through time (sixties until now-1) and is mandatory for people to understand and use for mundane tasks and software implementations.

The understanding requirement part of mundane stuff will disappear, so you spend more time on the creative process instead of the technical process. This will make the (global) economy scale.
