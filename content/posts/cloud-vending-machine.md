title: 'The Cloud Vending Machine'
---
There’s a metaphor I keep coming back to when I think about modern cloud development: the vending machine.

Think about it. When you walk up to a vending machine, you don’t wonder how it was stocked or who maintains it. You just press a button and get what you need. Fast, predictable, and (usually ;-)) reliable.

That’s how the cloud should work.

But for most teams, building in the cloud still feels like assembling the vending machine from parts every time you want a snack. You’re setting up infrastructure, configuring pipelines, stitching together services, and navigating endless layers of DevOps complexity. Even with great platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, the work behind the scenes can be overwhelming—especially when velocity matters.

I believe we need to shift our mindset. The cloud should feel like a vending machine: on-demand, automated, and deeply integrated with how developers already work.

Multistax takes this vending machine idea and make it real—wrapping cloud engineering and DevOps into one product that just works. With Multistax, you don’t need to reinvent your infrastructure every time. You plug into GitLab, GitHub or similar solutions, select what you need, and deploy with confidence.
In practice, cloud- and devops engineering is "solved" and does not require any further significant investment.

It’s not about replacing your team—it’s about giving them a better interface. A faster path to production. And a way to spend more time building features instead of wrestling with the plumbing.

We don’t need more complexity in the cloud. We need better vending machines.
