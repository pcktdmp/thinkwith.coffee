+++

2025 is all about Agentic AI. Organizations rushing to the digital riverbed for 'artificial' gold, only to find 
themselves observing others trying to yield the same value without the right knowledge and tools.

While the (applied) technology has a lot of potential, generating business value out of it is still at very early stages. 
There are a lot of products who bring DIY Agentic AI capabilities, yet embedding it in an organization and yielding value
is where organizations struggle. 
People simply don't know how to deal with and oversee 'it'. Is it a threat? Do I lose control? Will it have a heartbeat? 
Will it do my dishes?

My job is to provide strategic value to our customers, while observing the market flooding with Agentic AI 
management tools I have chosen to not jump that bandwagon (yet), simply because it is not mature enough for the masses 
to deeply integrate in organizational process.

To provide direct value through our products we deliver that (guaranteed) yield, instead of yet another technology stack 
to adopt with all the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) implied.

Based on the 'focus on the delivered output' philosophy, in [Multistax](https://sue.nl/products/multistax/), we have created 'Agentic FinOps' which 
delivers direct actionable (persistent) cost reduction for your workload in any cloud. In this case, FinOps embedded in your workload 
instead of a separate human practice. This way you don't need to manage Agentic AI yourself, Multistax does that for you.
