title = 'Generative AI II(I): Rise of the Agents'
+++

2025 is all about Agentic AI. Organizations rushing to the digital riverbed for 'artificial' gold, only to find 
themselves observing others trying to yield the same value without the right knowledge and tools.

While the (applied) technology has a lot of potential, generating business value out of it is still at very early stages. 
There are a lot of products who bring DIY Agentic AI capabilities, yet embedding it in an organization and yielding is 
where people struggle. 
People simply don't know how to deal with and oversee 'it'. Is it a threat? Do I lose control? Will it have a heartbeat? 
Will it do my dishes?

My job is to provide strategic value to our customers, while observing the market flooding with Agentic AI 
management tools I have chosen to not jump that bandwagon (yet), simply because it is not mature enough for the masses.

To provide direct value through our products we deliver the guaranteed yield instead of yet another technology stack 
to adopt with all the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) implied.

Based on this philosophy [Multistax](https://sue.nl/products/multistax/) we have created 'Agentic FinOps' which 
delivers direct actionable (persistent) cost reduction for your workload in any cloud. FinOps embedded in your workload 
instead of a separate practice. This way you don't need to manage Agentic AI yourself, Multistax does that for you.
