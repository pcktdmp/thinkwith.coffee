title: 'Sovereign Cloud Isn’t a Migration Problem'
---
Most teams treat sovereign cloud like a logistics problem. Spin up a local region. Wrap it in compliance. Copy the infra. Move the data. Done.

But this isn’t about copying and pasting your stack into a new jurisdiction. It’s about accepting a new reality: the cloud is no longer neutral ground. It’s a political territory.

Geopolitics is now infrastructure. A new law, a new sanction, or a new interpretation of “access” can ripple through your architecture overnight. Sovereignty means knowing where your data lives, who can touch it, and what happens if that changes tomorrow.

You don’t get that resilience by executing harder. You get it by thinking differently. By designing for boundaries instead of assuming openness. By embedding jurisdiction into your architecture—not duct-taping it after the fact.

Sovereign cloud isn’t a checkbox. It’s a shift in posture.

Sovereign cloud isn't a state to be in. It's a continuum.

It’s not about the next migration.

It’s about the one you don’t see coming.
